## 1. Introduction

### Overview of PMX Editor

PMX Editor is a dedicated 3D modeling application for creating and modifying models compatible with MikuMikuDance (MMD). It primarily utilizes the `.pmx` file format, an advanced iteration of the older `.pmd` format, offering enhanced features for rigging, morphing, physics simulation, and material definition. The editor's extensibility via plugins makes it a powerful tool for custom model development.

### Target Audience and Purpose

This documentation is intended for software developers aiming to create plugins or external tools that interact with PMX Editor or the PMX file format. It provides technical insights into the editor's architecture, plugin development methodologies, file format specifics, and best practices, addressing the general lack of official developer-focused documentation.

## 2. Core Technical Concepts

### The PMX File Format

#### General Structure and Signature

The PMX (Polygon Model eXtended) format is the contemporary standard for MMD models (v7.31+).

- **Signature:** Files begin with the ASCII string `"PMX "` (note the trailing space).
    
- **Version:** A `float` indicating the PMX version (e.g., 2.0, 2.1).
    
- **Globals Header:** A fixed-size block defining global parameters:
    
    - Text encoding (UTF-16LE or UTF-8).
        
    - Sizes (in bytes: 1, 2, or 4) for indices related to vertices, textures, materials, bones, morphs, and rigid bodies. This structure facilitates more complex models compared to the PMD format.
        

#### Key Data Segments

A PMX file is composed of distinct data sections, typically including:

1. **Model Information:** Names, comments (often in Japanese and English).
    
2. **Vertex Data:** Positions, normals, UV coordinates (up to 4 sets per vertex), bone weights (BDEF1/2/4, SDEF, QDEF), edge scaling factor.
    
3. **Face (Index) Data:** Defines triangular faces using vertex indices.
    
4. **Texture Table:** A list of paths to external texture files (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.tga`, `.dds`, `.spa`, `.sph`).
    
5. **Material Data:** Surface properties including diffuse, specular, ambient colors; shininess; edge color/size; texture/sphere/toon map indices; rendering flags.
    
6. **Bone Data:** Hierarchical skeletal structure, including bone names, positions, parent/target indices, IK links, and various behavioral flags.
    
7. **Morph Data:** Defines shape variations (vertex, bone, UV, material, group morphs).
    
8. **Display Frame Data:** Organizes bones and morphs into groups for the editor's UI.
    
9. **Rigid Body Data:** Parameters for physics simulation (shape, mass, friction, restitution, associated bone, collision group/mask).
    
10. **Joint Data:** Constraints connecting rigid bodies for physics.
    

#### Deformation Types (BDEF, SDEF)

PMX supports several skinning methods for vertex deformation by bones:

- **BDEF1:** Influence from a single bone.
    
- **BDEF2:** Linear blend between two bones.
    
- **BDEF4:** Linear blend between up to four bones.
    
- **SDEF (Spherical Deformation):** A more complex algorithm for smoother deformations, especially at joints. It involves additional weight parameters (C, R0, R1 vectors) per vertex for the two influencing bones. The exact SDEF calculation is not officially documented.
    
- **QDEF (Quaternion-based Deformation):** An experimental type, less commonly used.
    

### PMX Editor Architecture

#### Rendering Engine (DirectX via SlimDX)

PMX Editor is a Windows application utilizing the .NET Framework (typically 4.x). Its 3D rendering is powered by DirectX 9.0c, accessed through the **SlimDX** library, which is a .NET wrapper for DirectX APIs. Plugins requiring graphical output or manipulation of 3D data will interact with SlimDX.

#### Plugin Subsystem

The editor features a binary plugin system. Plugins are typically .NET assemblies (DLLs) written in C# that interface with PMX Editor's core functionalities.

- **Plugin Location:** DLLs are placed in the `_plugin\User\` (or similar) subdirectory of the PMX Editor installation.
    
- **API Access:** Plugins interact with the editor via `PEPlugin.dll`, which exposes interfaces for model data manipulation, UI interaction, and other services.
    

## 3. Plugin Development Environment Setup

### System and Software Prerequisites

- **Operating System:** Windows (Windows 10 or newer recommended).
    
- **IDE:** Microsoft Visual Studio (e.g., 2019, 2022) with .NET desktop development workload.
    
- **.NET Framework:** PMX Editor and its plugins target older .NET Framework versions (see below).
    
- **PMX Editor Installation:** Required for accessing core DLLs and testing.
    

### Essential Libraries: `PEPlugin.dll` and `SlimDX.dll`

These are the cornerstone DLLs for plugin development:

- `PEPlugin.dll`: The primary API library for PMX Editor. It contains interfaces and classes for accessing and modifying model data, interacting with the editor's UI, and managing plugin operations.
    
- `SlimDX.dll`: A .NET wrapper for Microsoft DirectX. It's used for 3D graphics operations, vector and matrix math, and any direct rendering tasks.
    

Both DLLs must be referenced in your plugin project. They are found within the PMX Editor's installation directory. It's common practice to copy these to a `lib` folder within your project and reference them from there. Ensure these files are "unblocked" in their Windows properties if downloaded from the internet.

### Project Configuration in Visual Studio

#### .NET Framework Version

- **Target Framework:** Set your Class Library project to **.NET Framework 4.7.2** or **.NET Framework 4.8**. Using newer versions like .NET Core or .NET 5+ will result in incompatible assemblies.
    

#### C# Language Version

- **Language Version:** Set to **C# 7.3** or lower. (Project Properties → Build → Advanced → Language version). PMX Editor's host environment does not support newer C# features (e.g., C# 8.0+ range operators, default interface methods).
    

#### Platform Target (x86/x64)

- **Platform Target:** Typically **x86 (32-bit)**. While 64-bit versions of PMX Editor exist, targeting x86 ensures broader compatibility unless you are specifically developing for an x64 environment and the editor version explicitly supports it. (Project Properties → Build → Platform target).
    

## 4. Developing Plugins for PMX Editor

### Plugin Lifecycle and Entry Point (`IPEPlugin`)

A PMX Editor plugin is a .NET class library (DLL) that implements the `IPEPlugin` interface from `PEPlugin.dll`. Key members of `IPEPlugin`:

- `Name` (string): The display name of the plugin.
    
- `Version` (string): The plugin's version number.
    
- `Description` (string): A brief description of the plugin.
    
- `Run(IPERunArgs args)` (void): The main execution method called when the plugin is invoked from the editor. The `IPERunArgs` argument provides access to the host editor's services and the current model.
    

```
using PEPlugin;
using PEPlugin.Pmx; // For IPXPmx, etc.
using PEPlugin.PE;   // For IPERunArgs, etc.
using System.Windows.Forms; // For MessageBox

public class SamplePlugin : IPEPlugin
{
    public string Name => "Sample Plugin";
    public string Version => "1.0.0";
    public string Description => "A basic PMX Editor plugin.";

    public void Run(IPERunArgs args)
    {
        // Access the host and PMX data
        IPEPluginHost host = args.Host;
        IPXPmx pmx = host.Connector.Pmx;

        if (pmx == null)
        {
            MessageBox.Show("No PMX model is currently loaded.", "Plugin Info", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);
            return;
        }

        MessageBox.Show($"Model '{pmx.ModelInfo.ModelName}' loaded. It has {pmx.Vertex.Count} vertices.", "Plugin Info", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Information);
        
        // Plugin logic here
    }
}
```

### Interacting with PMX Editor API

#### Accessing Model Data (`IPXPmx`, `IPXPmxBuilder`)

- `IPXPmx`: Represents the currently loaded PMX model. It provides access to collections of vertices, faces, materials, bones, morphs, etc. (e.g., `pmx.Vertex`, `pmx.Bone`). This interface is primarily for reading data.
    
- `IPXPmxBuilder`: Used for constructing new PMX elements (e.g., `builder.Vertex()`, `builder.Bone()`). This is essential when modifying the model or creating new parts. The `IPXPmx` object is typically obtained via `args.Host.Connector.Pmx`. The `IPXPmxBuilder` is often obtained via `args.Host.Connector.PmxBuilder`.
    

#### Manipulating Bones (`IPXBone`)

Bones are accessed via `pmx.Bone` (a list of `IPXBone` objects).

```
// Example: Iterate through bones and print their names
foreach (IPXBone bone in pmx.Bone)
{
    System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Bone: {bone.Name}");
}

// Example: Create a new bone (conceptual, using builder)
// IPXPmxBuilder builder = args.Host.Connector.PmxBuilder;
// IPXBone newBone = builder.Bone();
// newBone.Name = "MyNewBone";
// newBone.Position = new PEPlugin.SDX.V3(0, 1, 0); // Using SlimDX V3 type
// pmx.Bone.Add(newBone); // Modifying collections usually requires updating the view
```

#### Working with Morphs (`IPXMorph`)

Morphs are accessed via `pmx.Morph`. Each `IPXMorph` object has a `MorphType` and a list of offsets.

```
// Example: List vertex morphs
foreach (IPXMorph morph in pmx.Morph)
{
    if (morph.MorphType == MorphType.Vertex)
    {
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine($"Vertex Morph: {morph.Name}");
    }
}
```

#### Handling Materials (`IPXMaterial`) and UVs

Materials define surface appearance. `pmx.Material` provides a list of `IPXMaterial`. UVs are part of `IPXVertex` data.

```
// Example: Change diffuse color of the first material
if (pmx.Material.Count > 0)
{
    IPXMaterial firstMaterial = pmx.Material[0];
    firstMaterial.Diffuse = new PEPlugin.SDX.V4(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f); // Red color (R,G,B,A)
    // Remember to update the view/model if changes are made
    // args.Host.Connector.View.UpdatePmxView(); or similar
}
```

#### Managing Physics Components (`IPXRigidBody`, `IPXJoint`)

Rigid bodies and joints are accessed via `pmx.RigidBody` and `pmx.Joint` respectively.

### C# Scripting within PMX Editor

Some versions of PMX Editor include a C# scripting window, allowing for quick automation or testing of small code snippets without compiling a full plugin. The API available in the scripting environment is generally the same as for compiled plugins.

## 5. Best Practices and Common Pitfalls

### API Versioning and Compatibility

Be aware that `PEPlugin.dll` might have different versions across various PMX Editor distributions. Plugins compiled against one version might not be compatible with another if there are breaking API changes. Aim for widely distributed PMX Editor versions if possible.

### Null Reference Handling

Always check for `null` before accessing properties or methods of objects obtained from the PMX Editor API, especially `pmx`, `builder`, or individual model elements.

```
IPXMaterial material = builder.Material(); // Assuming builder is IPXPmxBuilder
if (material != null)
{
    material.Name = "NewMaterial";
}
else
{
    // Log error or handle appropriately
    PEPlugin.System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Failed to create material instance.");
}
```

### Avoiding Modern C# Features

As stated, PMX Editor's .NET environment is older. Avoid:

- C# 8.0+ syntax (index/range operators `data[1..^0]`, null-coalescing assignments `??=`, etc.).
    
- `init` properties, `record` types.
    
- `Span<T>`, `Memory<T>`.
    
- Complex LINQ expressions if they cause issues (simpler ones are usually fine). Stick to traditional loops for reliability.
    

### Correct Referencing and Initialization

- Ensure `PEPlugin.dll` and `SlimDX.dll` are correctly referenced and accessible at runtime.
    
- Properly initialize API objects using the provided builders or connectors.
    

### Memory Management and Performance

- PMX Editor, especially 32-bit versions, can be memory-intensive with large models.
    
- Undo/Redo operations consume significant memory.
    
- Write efficient code, especially when iterating over large collections (vertices, faces).
    
- Dispose of `IDisposable` objects if you create any that are not managed by the editor (less common with SlimDX in this context, but good practice).
    

## 6. Troubleshooting Common Development Issues

### DLL Loading Errors (Blocked Files, Missing Dependencies)

- **"Operation not supported" / File Blocked:** If DLLs are downloaded, Windows might block them. Right-click the DLL → Properties → Unblock.
    
- **Missing `netstandard.dll` or similar:** Indicates plugin was compiled against an incompatible .NET version (e.g., .NET Core/.NET Standard). Re-target to .NET Framework 4.7.2/4.8.
    
- **`SlimDX.dll` or `PEPlugin.dll` not found:** Ensure these are in the PMX Editor's execution path or alongside your plugin if not correctly referenced.
    

### Compilation Errors (Type Mismatches, Missing Member Definitions)

- **"'IPXMaterial' does not contain a definition for 'FaceCount'"**: This property might not exist or is calculated internally. Consult API examples or use IntelliSense.
    
- **"'IPXVertex' does not contain a definition for 'Def'"**: The property name for deformation type might be different or accessed via a method.
    
- **"Method must declare a body"**: Ensure all non-abstract, non-extern, non-partial methods have an implementation (`{ }`), even if empty.
    
- **Type Mismatches (e.g., `V3` vs. custom vector types):** Always use types from `PEPlugin.SDX` (e.g., `PEPlugin.SDX.V3`, `PEPlugin.SDX.V4`) for vectors and matrices.
    

### Runtime Crashes

- **`NullReferenceException`:** Most common; due to not checking for `null` before using an API object.
    
- **`IndexOutOfRangeException`:** When accessing collections, always check bounds.
    
- **Architecture Mismatch:** Running an x64 plugin in an x86 editor or vice-versa.
    

## 7. Advanced Topics

### Understanding SDEF Internals (Reverse Engineered)

The SDEF (Spherical Deformation) skinning method provides smoother joint deformations. While the PMX specification defines the data structure (weights for two bones, and three `V3` vectors: C, R0, R1), the exact mathematical formula used by MMD and PMX Editor for applying these weights is not officially documented. Community efforts have reverse-engineered plausible formulas, which are crucial for tools that need to accurately replicate MMD's skinning behavior (e.g., exporters to game engines, custom renderers). Researching these community findings is necessary for advanced SDEF manipulation or implementation.

### Interoperability with Other Tools (e.g., Blender MMD Tools)

Many workflows involve moving models between PMX Editor and other 3D software like Blender.

- **MMD Tools for Blender:** A popular Blender addon that supports importing and exporting PMX, PMD, VMD (motion), and VPD (pose) files. Understanding how MMD Tools handles conversions (e.g., SDEF to Blender weight painting, material interpretation) can be beneficial for developers creating complementary tools or plugins.
    
- **Coordinate Systems and Scaling:** Be mindful of differences in coordinate systems (Y-up vs. Z-up) and units when transferring models.
    

## 8. Community and Resources

## Section 5: Best Practices and Troubleshooting

This section details best practices for plugin development and provides solutions to common issues, particularly those encountered when creating plugins with Windows Forms UIs.

### 5.1 General Best Practices

-   **Target Framework and Language**: To ensure maximum compatibility, target **.NET Framework 4.7.2** or **4.8** and set the C# Language Version to **7.3** or lower in your project settings. Newer .NET or C# features are not supported by the editor's host environment and will cause loading errors.
-   **Defensive API Usage**: Always perform null-checks before accessing objects returned by the PMX Editor API, such as `IPXPmx` or its component lists (`.Bone`, `.Material`, etc.). Wrap all plugin logic, especially in the `Run()` method and event handlers, in `try-catch` blocks to prevent unhandled exceptions from crashing the entire editor.
-   **Update Editor Views**: After programmatically modifying model data, the editor's UI will not update automatically. You must explicitly call methods like `args.Host.Connector.Form.UpdateList()` or `args.Host.Connector.View.UpdateView()` to refresh the display.

### 5.2 Troubleshooting: Windows Forms Plugins

Developing plugins with a Windows Forms UI introduces a unique set of challenges. The following are solutions to the most common problems.

#### 5.2.1 Design-Time Errors (Visual Studio Designer)

These errors typically prevent the form from being viewed or edited visually.

**Problem: The designer fails to open, showing only the code view.**

* **Cause**: The form's constructor requires an `IPERunArgs` parameter, which the Visual Studio designer cannot provide. The designer requires a **parameterless constructor** to render the form.
* **Solution**: Provide two constructors. The parameterless constructor is used exclusively by the designer, while the constructor that accepts `IPERunArgs` is used by the plugin at runtime. It is also critical to guard any host-dependent logic with a `this.DesignMode` check.

    ```csharp
    // In MyForm.cs
    public partial class MyForm : Form
    {
        // Constructor for the Visual Studio Designer ONLY
        public MyForm()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }
    
        // Constructor used by the plugin at runtime
        public MyForm(IPERunArgs args)
        {
            InitializeComponent();
            // Pass args to a separate method to load data
            LoadModelData(args);
        }

        private void LoadModelData(IPERunArgs args)
        {
            // This check prevents code from running in the designer
            if (this.DesignMode) return;

            // Safely access args.Host, etc. here
        }
    }
    ```

**Problem: The designer crashes with an error like "The designer cannot process the code..."**

* **Cause**: The `InitializeComponent()` method in the `.Designer.cs` file contains C# syntax that the designer's simple code parser cannot understand, such as lambda expressions (`=>`) or other complex logic.
* **Solution**: The `InitializeComponent()` method must remain purely declarative. Avoid any advanced C# features or imperative logic within it. Replace any such code with simple, repetitive property assignments.

**Problem: Compilation errors like "Ambiguity between members" or "Type already contains a definition for..."**

* **Cause**: A field for a UI control (e.g., `private Button myButton;`) has been declared in *both* `MyForm.cs` and `MyForm.Designer.cs`.
* **Solution**: All UI control fields must be declared **only** in the `MyForm.Designer.cs` file. Your logic file (`MyForm.cs`) can access them directly as they are part of the same `partial` class.

#### 5.2.2 Runtime Errors and Stability

These errors occur after the plugin has been loaded and is running inside PMX Editor.

**Problem: The plugin crashes on launch with a `NullReferenceException`.**

* **Cause A: Architecture Mismatch.** The plugin is compiled for a different architecture than the host application (e.g., an `x86` plugin in `PmxEditor_x64.exe`). While it may appear in the menu, the .NET runtime can fail to initialize objects correctly, leading to crashes.
* **Solution A:** Verify the host executable and set the **Platform target** in your project properties to explicitly match (`x86` or `x64`).

* **Cause B: Premature Data Access.** The code attempts to get the model state via `GetCurrentState()` when no model is loaded, or it attempts to use the `IPERunArgs` object before it has been properly initialized.
* **Solution B:** Move data loading logic from the form's constructor to the `Form_Load` event. This ensures the form and its dependencies are fully initialized. Perform robust null-checking on the `IPERunArgs` object and the returned model data before use.

**Problem: The application freezes and crashes when selecting an item in a `ListBox`.**

* **Cause**: The `SelectedIndexChanged` event handler modifies the same list it is observing, then programmatically resets the selection, which re-triggers the event and creates an infinite loop, leading to a `StackOverflowException`.
* **Solution**: Temporarily unsubscribe the event handler before modifying the list's data. Re-subscribe the handler within a `finally` block to ensure the connection is always restored.

**Problem: PMX Editor crashes when the plugin window is closed using the 'X' button.**

* **Cause**: The form's `Dispose()` method is called, which conflicts with the plugin host's lifecycle management.
* **Solution**: Intercept the `FormClosing` event. If the close reason is `UserClosing`, cancel the event and simply hide the form (`e.Cancel = true; this.Hide();`). The main plugin class should be responsible for disposing of the form when the editor unloads the plugin.

#### 5.2.3 Data and Logic Integrity

**Problem: Logic fails because it's operating on "stale" model data.**

* **Cause**: Storing references to model objects (e.g., `IPXBone`) is unreliable. When `GetCurrentState()` is called again, new instances of all model objects are created in memory. The previously stored references are now "stale" and will fail reference equality checks (`.IndexOf()`, `==`, etc.).
* **Architectural Solution**: **Store indices, not objects.** Maintain a `List<int>` of selected item indices. This index is a stable identifier. Before processing, get a fresh model state via `GetCurrentState()` and use the stored indices to retrieve the current, valid object instances from the new state's collections.

**Problem: Setting a property (e.g., Collision Group to `2`) results in a different value in the UI (e.g., `Group 3`).**

* **Cause**: A discrepancy between the user-facing, 1-based indexing in the editor UI and the internal, 0-based indexing used by the API.
* **Solution**: Manually adjust the value before assigning it to an API property to account for the offset (e.g., `apiObject.Group = ui_value - 1;`).
